This is My first Project in Learning Fundamentals of Javascript, learning this is quite fun and stressing to build but building this help me in alot of area,
here's a list of the things I've learn:
  <br>-what is function?<br>
  <br>-why is it important?<br>
  <br>-when/where to use it<br>
  <br>(note: this first three question are my opening if i ever want to learn someting new)<br>
 <br> -how can you build a function <br>
 <br> -how function receive values using paramaters<br>
  <br>-What is hoisting<br>
 <br> -the types of primitive data types<br>
 <br> -re asssigning variables<br>
 <br> -also making pixel arts haha<br>
 <br> -how to add guard clause in if/else statements<br>

  note: i use ai for tips and ive been practicing on limiting to use for me not to rely on it<br>
